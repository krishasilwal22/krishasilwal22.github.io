        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="about-container">
            <p>
                I’m an Economics and Data Science student with a strong interest in using data to analyze policies, economic trends, and social structures.  
                My work involves statistical analysis, data visualization, and data-driven research to uncover insights that support informed decision-making.
            </p>
            <p>
                I approach data with a focus on clarity and real-world relevance, ensuring that my analysis is not just technically accurate but also meaningful.  
                I enjoy breaking down complex datasets, identifying patterns and trends, and understanding how data reflects economic and social realities.
            </p>
            <p>
                This portfolio showcases projects where I have explored economic and social issues through a quantitative lens,  
                applying data analysis and visualization techniques to interpret trends and assess outcomes.  
                These projects are helping me develop the analytical and computational skills needed to advance my interest in policy research, economic justice, and gender-based economic disparities.

            <div class="project-card" onclick="toggleProject('project1')">
                <h3>Hand Tracking & Object Interaction</h3>
                <p>Developed a real-time hand tracking system using Python & OpenCV.</p>
                <span class="expand">Expand ⬇</span>
                <div id="project1" class="project-details">
                    <h4>Problem Statement:</h4>
                    <p>Traditional input devices like a mouse and keyboard are not accessible to everyone. Gesture-based systems offer an alternative,  
                        but many require precise hand movements, limiting accessibility.</p>
                    <h4>What We Built:</h4>
                    <p>We developed a real-time hand tracking system that detects hand movements and allows users to move digital blocks on the screen using just their hands.</p>
                    <h4>Technologies Used:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Python – Logic for hand tracking</li>
                        <li>OpenCV – Capturing video and detecting hand positions</li>
                        <li>cvzone – Simplified gesture-based interactions</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Impact & Shortcomings:</h4>
                    <p>This system provided an accessible way to interact with digital objects without physical input devices, demonstrating how AI can improve accessibility.  
                        However, it still required some level of precision, which may be difficult for individuals with severe motor impairments.</p>
                    <h4>Future Improvements:</h4>
                    <p>Increase tracking precision, add customizable sensitivity levels, and expand the range of interactions beyond block movement.</p>

                <h3>Analyzing the Gender Pay Gap</h3>
                <p>Used Excel & regression models to explore wage disparities across states.</p>
                <span class="expand">Expand ⬇</span>
                <div id="project2" class="project-details">
                    <h4>Problem Statement:</h4>
                    <p>The gender pay gap persists across U.S. states, influenced by factors like minimum wage policies, labor force participation,  
                        and unemployment rates.</p>
                    <h4>Technologies Used:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Excel – Data visualization & regression models</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Findings & Shortcomings:</h4>
                    <p>The regression analysis showed correlations between minimum wage and gender pay disparities,  
                        but data limitations prevented accounting for industry-specific differences.</p>
                    <h4>Future Improvements:</h4>
                    <p>Use more granular datasets with industry segmentation and integrate additional economic indicators for better predictive power.</p>

                <div id="project3" class="project-details">
                    <h4>Problem Statement:</h4>
                    <p>Businesses often struggle with incomplete employee data, making it difficult to predict purchasing behavior and financial decisions.</p>
                    <h4>What We Did:</h4>
                    <p>We cleaned and formatted raw company data, handled missing values through imputation, and created machine learning models to predict  
                        employee purchase behavior based on job role, salary, and work location.</p>
                    <h4>Technologies Used:</h4>

                    </ul>
                    <h4>Impact & Future Improvements:</h4>
                    <p>The model showed promising accuracy but lacked real-time adaptability. Future enhancements could involve deeper feature engineering  
                        and integration with live company data.</p>
