        <div class="about-container">
            <p>
                I’m an Economics and Data Science student with a strong interest in using data to analyze policies, economic trends, and social structures. 
                My work involves statistical analysis, data visualization, and data-driven research to uncover insights that support informed decision-making.
            </p>
            <p>
                This portfolio showcases projects where I have applied data analysis to explore fundamental concepts in programming, machine learning, and statistical modeling.
                Through these projects, I have gained experience in working with real-world datasets, refining my technical skills, and developing a structured approach to problem-solving. 
                These experiences are helping me build a strong foundation in data analysis, which I aim to apply to research on economic inequality, labor markets, and gender-based economic disparities.

                <div class="project-details">
                    <p>For people with limited motor control, using a mouse or keyboard can be challenging, making digital interactions difficult. We wanted to explore an alternative way to interact with technology that didn’t rely on traditional input devices.</p>
                    <h4>What We Built</h4>
                    <p>We developed a real-time hand tracking system that allows users to move blocks on a screen using only their hands.</p>
                    <h4>Technologies Used:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Python – Program logic for hand tracking</li>
                        <li>OpenCV – Capturing video and detecting hand movements</li>
                        <li>cvzone – Simplified gesture-based interactions</li>

                <h3>Analyzing the Gender Pay Gap</h3>
                <p>Used Excel & regression models to explore wage disparities across states.</p>
                <span class="expand">Expand ⬇</span>
                <div id="project2" class="project-details">
                    <p>Even though the gender pay gap is widely discussed, the specific factors driving wage differences across states aren’t always clear. I wanted to explore this issue through data, analyzing whether economic policies and labor conditions play a role in shaping these disparities and if certain policies might help close the gap.</p>

                    <h4>What I Did & How It Works</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Collected wage data from 25 U.S. states, examining five economic indicators: Minimum wage, Unemployment rate, Median annual earnings for women, Percentage of women in the labor forc, Presence of pay transparency laws</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Used Excel’s regression analysis to test which factors were most predictive of gender pay disparities.</li>
                        <li>Examined correlations to identify whether certain policies (e.g., pay transparency laws) reduced wage gaps.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Technologies Used</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Excel</strong> – Data collection, regression modeling, and data visualization</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Findings & Impact</h4>
                    <p>The analysis showed that minimum wage policies and labor force participation had some connection to the gender pay gap, but they alone did not fully explain the disparities. While the model provided insight into how economic conditions relate to wage differences, it also highlighted the limitations of using only a few economic indicators to understand a complex issue.</p>
                    <p>This project reinforced the importance of data selection and model design when analyzing social and economic problems. It showed that while quantitative analysis can reveal patterns, fully understanding issues like wage inequality requires a broader approach that includes additional variables and deeper statistical methods.</p>

                    <h4>Future Improvements</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Include more states to improve statistical reliability</li>
                        <li>Use more advanced statistical models to capture complex relationships</li>
                        <li>Collect data on occupational segregation and education levels to refine analysis</li>

                <h3>Machine Learning for Employee Data</h3>
                <p>Built ML models to predict employee purchases using data cleaning & imputation.</p>

                    <p>Companies use employee purchase data to predict buying behaviors, but raw data is often messy, incomplete, and unstructured. This project aimed to clean and structure raw company data, apply data imputation, and build a simple model to improve purchase predictions.</p>

                    <h4>What I Did & How It Works</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cleaned and formatted raw employee data: Removed duplicates,Handled missing values, Standardized inputs</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Used Excel for data preprocessing and Tableau for visualization of purchasing patterns.</li>
                        <li>Created a confusion matrix to test the accuracy of predictions against actual purchases.</li>
                        <li>Calculated precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy to evaluate model performance.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Cleaning data significantly improved model accuracy, showing how data quality affects machine learning outcomes.</li>
                        <li>The confusion matrix highlighted where the model misclassified purchases, showing biases in the raw data.</li>

                <h3>Transgender Inclusion in Nepal</h3>
                <p>Research analyzing legal barriers to gender identity recognition.</p>

                <div id="project4" class="project-details">
                    <p>Nepal allows a third gender option on legal documents, but changing one's gender marker still requires proof of surgery. This rule creates barriers, especially for transgender individuals from marginalized and low-income backgrounds, limiting their access to jobs, healthcare, and legal rights.</p>

                    <h4>What I Did & How It Works</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Collected and analyzed qualitative and quantitative data on Nepal’s gender recognition policies and their impact.</li>
                        <li>Used data interpretation techniques to explore how legal restrictions correlate with employment barriers, economic inequality, and social mobility for transgender individuals.</li>
                        <li>Studied case studies, government policies, and advocacy reports to quantify how many individuals have successfully changed their gender marker.</li>
                        <li>Applied intersectional feminist theory to understand how caste, class, and gender identity affect access to legal recognition.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Technologies & Methods Used</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Qualitative Data Analysis – Studied legal documents and advocacy reports.</li>
                        <li>Data Interpretation & Visualization – Examined correlations between gender recognition policies and economic inequality.</li>
                        <li>Intersectional Analysis – Assessed how caste, gender identity, and socioeconomic status impact legal recognition.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Findings & Impact</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Only 10 individuals have successfully changed their gender marker, highlighting how restrictive and inaccessible the process is.</li>
                        <li>Legal barriers disproportionately affect lower-income and marginalized caste individuals, limiting their ability to access employment and economic opportunities.</li>
                        <li>The research contributed to policy discussions and legal advocacy efforts, emphasizing the need for self-identification laws without medical requirements.</li>
