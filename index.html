    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I’m an Economics and Data Science student with a strong interest in using data to analyze policies and economic trends. My work involves statistical analysis, data visualization, and data-driven research to uncover insights that support informed decision-making.</p>
        <p>I approach data with a focus on clarity and real-world relevance, ensuring that my analysis is not just technically accurate but also meaningful. I enjoy breaking down complex datasets, identifying patterns and trends, and understanding how data reflects economic and social realities. I also pay attention to biases and limitations in data to make sure my findings are as objective and useful as possible.</p>
        <p>This portfolio showcases projects where I have explored economic and social issues through a quantitative lens, applying data analysis and visualization techniques to interpret trends and assess outcomes. By integrating data science with economic and feminist theory, I aim to uncover data-driven evidence of inequities, quantify the impact of policies, and analyze how economic systems affect different social groups.</p>

                <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                <p>Traditional input devices like a mouse and keyboard are not accessible to everyone, particularly individuals with limited fine motor control or physical impairments. Gesture-based systems offer an alternative, but many applications still require precise hand movements, making them difficult to use for many people.</p>

                <h3>What We Built & How It Works</h3>
                <p>We developed a real-time hand tracking system that detects hand movements through a webcam and allows users to interact with blocks on the screen. If a hand moves close to a block, it "grabs" the block, allowing it to be moved. When stacked, the blocks behave as if they are real, staying in place unless moved again.</p>

                <h4>Technologies We Used</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Python – To program the logic behind object movement.</li>
                    <li>OpenCV – For capturing video and detecting hand positions.</li>
                    <li>cvzone – To simplify hand tracking and gesture-based interactions.</li>
                </ul>
