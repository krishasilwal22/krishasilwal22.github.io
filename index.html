    <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m an Economics and Data Science student with a strong interest in using data to analyze policies and economic trends. My work involves statistical analysis, data visualization, and data-driven research to uncover insights that support informed decision-making.</p>

    <p>I approach data with a focus on clarity and real-world relevance, ensuring that my analysis is not just technically accurate but also meaningful. I enjoy breaking down complex datasets, identifying patterns and trends, and understanding how data reflects economic and social realities. I also pay attention to biases and limitations in data to make sure my findings are as objective and useful as possible.</p>

    <p>This portfolio showcases projects where I have explored economic and social issues through a quantitative lens, applying data analysis and visualization techniques to interpret trends and assess outcomes. By integrating data science with economic and feminist theory, I aim to uncover data-driven evidence of inequities, quantify the impact of policies, and analyze how economic systems affect different social groups. Using techniques such as regression analysis, data visualization, and predictive modeling, I seek to make structural inequalities more measurable and transparent, providing insights that can support informed policymaking and advocacy efforts.</p>

    <!-- Hand Tracking & Object Interaction -->
    <div class="project">
        <button class="project-title" onclick="toggleProject('project1')">Hand Tracking & Object Interaction ⬇</button>
        <div class="project-details" id="project1">
            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>Traditional input devices like a mouse and keyboard are not accessible to everyone, particularly individuals with limited fine motor control or physical impairments. Gesture-based systems offer an alternative, but many applications still require precise hand movements, making them difficult to use for many people.</p>
            
            <p>While creating this project, we were interested in exploring how hand tracking technology could allow users to interact with digital objects more intuitively. Our goal was to develop a system where users could move and stack virtual blocks using only their hands, without needing a mouse or keyboard.</p>

            <h3>What We Built & How It Works</h3>
            <p>We developed a real-time hand tracking system that detects hand movements through a webcam and allows users to interact with blocks on the screen. If a hand moves close to a block, it "grabs" the block, allowing it to be moved. When stacked, the blocks behave as if they are real, staying in place unless moved again.</p>

            <h4>Technologies We Used</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Python – To program the logic behind object movement.</li>
                <li>OpenCV – For capturing video and detecting hand positions.</li>
                <li>cvzone – To simplify hand tracking and gesture-based interactions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why This Matters & Potential Applications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Could be helpful for users who find traditional input devices challenging.</li>
                <li><strong>Potential Uses:</strong> Could be expanded for gesture-controlled games, AR/VR applications, and assistive technology.</li>
                <li><strong>Hands-Free Interaction:</strong> Demonstrates how computer vision can create intuitive digital experiences without physical controllers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What Could Be Improved?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Improve tracking accuracy using AI-based gesture recognition.</li>
                <li>Integrate voice control for users with limited hand mobility.</li>
                <li>Explore alternative inputs like eye tracking or adaptive gestures.</li>
                <li>Refine stacking logic for a smoother user experience.</li>
            </ul>
